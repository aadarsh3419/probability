📘 Bayes' Theorem - Real World Example: Medical Testing

This script demonstrates Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability
of actually having a disease given a positive test result.

Problem:
- A disease affects 2% of the population.
- The test has:
    ✅ 90% True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)
    ❌ 5% False Positive Rate (False alarm when person is healthy)

Goal:
- Given a person tests positive, what is the probability they truly have the disease?

# Given probabilities
P_D = 0.02                      # P(Disease)
P_not_D = 1 - P_D               # P(No Disease)
P_Pos_given_D = 0.90           # P(Positive | Disease)
P_Pos_given_not_D = 0.05       # P(Positive | No Disease)

# Bayes’ Theorem: P(Disease | Positive)
numerator = P_Pos_given_D * P_D
denominator = (P_Pos_given_D * P_D) + (P_Pos_given_not_D * P_not_D)
P_D_given_Pos = numerator / denominator

# Print the result
print("📊 Probability of having disease given a positive test result:")
print("P(Disease | Positive) =", round(P_D_given_Pos, 4))  # Rounded to 4 decimal places
